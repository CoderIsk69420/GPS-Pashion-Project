            <h2 style="color: #ffffff;"> The Reality Check</h2>
        <p>In the last two years, the technology industry has faced a "correction." After years of massive hiring, several factors have led to a decline in open positions for new software engineers.</p>

                <h3>The "Great Layoff"</h3>
                <p>Since 2023, over 400,000 tech workers have been laid off globally as companies try to cut costs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>AI Automation</h3>
                <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot can now write basic code, meaning companies need fewer junior developers to do entry-level work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>AI Takeover</h3>
                <p>AI has taken over most of the tech sectors job market as any company would take a reliable, cheap, and fast code writer,
                    than a non-reliable, quite expensive, and slow code writer Junior.

            <div class="cardsolution">
                <h3>Solutions: 1</h3>
                <p>Some CS tech sectors are still A.I. free, such as Cyber Security. As A.I. can not comprehend "human hacking",
                    and if you have seen Cybersecurity pay, it's pretty good.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="cardsolution">
                <h3>Solutions: 2</h3>
                <p>The US government already made a law for companies to come clean about their A.I. usage and layoff statistics, 
                    which let the public view their statistics.

                <h3>Solutions: 3</h3>
                <p>A.I. doesn't always ruin a junior developer's computer science career as there is a lot of A.I. learning courses that teach
                    people how to use A.I. along with their job with ease.
